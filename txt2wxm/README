Once the worksheet is completed you can enter it in wxmaxima

Once recognized by wxmaxima the order "evaluate all visible cells (crtl-R)"
will proceed to do all operations required. The user can experiment altering
parameters and orders and entering the new orders with crtl-ENTER as usual.

Language reecognized by the awk preprocessor:
---------------------------------------------
#TI title ........ General title.
#TS section ...... Section title
#TSS sub ......... Subsection
#TR text ......... General text with no special emphasis level.
# text ........... General text with no special emphasis level.

Any other line is assumed to be language to be interpreted by wxmaxima.
and classified as "code"

Several lines with the same classification level will be grouped as the
same cell in the wxm file. A code line that ends in a ";" will mark the
end of a cell.
